# optimization
OR Projects are here.
Some optimization problems are here, which  It was developed a long time ago for my master's degree thesis; those are about emergency location problems where we have Ambulance, Firefighter, and Police. They have to work collaboratively, so the idea of this project is split into three optimization problems : 

1-. It is necessary to cover the population for these three institutions. It has a budget
2-. It is desired to cover the population for these three institutions, and it is recompensed, which means the more institutions cover a specific place, the higher value they will get.
3-. This model is quite a different problem compared to the other ones. We have to consider a city and time, where we have a fleet which is known, and we have to move across the city to cover the most significant demand possible in this period, at the same way to the first problem is necessary to cover the population with these three institutions.

The problems were solved with Java+Cplex, on Eclipse IDE
