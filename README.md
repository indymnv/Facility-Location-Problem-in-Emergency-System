# optimization
OR Projects are here
Some optimization problems are here which I developed long time ago for my master degree's thesis, those are about emergency location
problems where we have Ambulance, Firefighter and Police and they have to work collaboratively, so the idea of this project is splitted
in 3 optimization problems : 

1-. Is necessary to cover population for these 3 institutions, It has a budget
2-. Is desired to cover population for these 3 institutions, and it is recompensed, that is mean the more institutions cover a specific
place the higher value they will get.
3-. This is a quite different problem compare the other ones, we have to consider a city and time, we have a fleet which is known and 
we have to move across the city to cover the largest demand possible in this period of time, at the same way to the first problem
is necessary to cover the population with these 3 institutions.

The problems were solved with Java+Cplex, on Eclipse IDE
